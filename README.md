# motorcycle_dash_prototype
Motorcycle dashboard software inspired by https://www.superbikeunlimited.com/i2m-chrome-plus-full-color-lcd-dash-gps-lap-timer-honda-kawasaki-suzuki-yamaha-ducati-mv-agusta-aprilia-bmw .
## Electronical requirement 
This project requires some electronicals parts like :

* Raspberry pi 3b+
* leds ans rdb led
more soon

## Software side :

* python 3
* pygame
more soon

## Material side
You probably will need a 3D printer for the dash case. I've printed this in PLA, but you can change the material for sure. More, incrase the head precision because you will need to do somes small parts like the leds hole. 
If you don't have 3D printer, it's time to make some friends who have some ;).
